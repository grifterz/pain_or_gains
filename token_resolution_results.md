# Token Resolution Implementation Results

## Summary
I've successfully removed all hardcoded fallback values from the token name resolution system, leaving only pure RPC and API-based lookups as requested. The system now properly reflects the actual data that can be retrieved from the blockchain.

## Current Resolution Results

For token `5HyZiyaSsQt8VZBAJcULZhtykiVmkAkWLiQJCER9pump`:

- **Current Name**: `5HyZiyaSsQ...` (derived from address)
- **Current Symbol**: `5HyZiy` (derived from address)

This is the result of purely relying on available RPC data without any hardcoded values.

## RPC Findings

The RPC tests revealed:

1. **Basic Token Info Available** - The token mint account contains basic information:
   - Decimals: 6
   - Supply: 995289247653623

2. **Metadata Not Retrieved** - The Metaplex metadata which would contain the name and symbol was not successfully retrieved through either:
   - Direct RPC calls to Solana mainnet
   - Public RPC endpoints (which returned a 410 error)

3. **API Limitations** - The Solscan API also returned limited information for this specific token.

## Implementation Notes

1. The current implementation follows a cascade of resolution methods:
   - First tries to get metadata through Solana RPC
   - Falls back to basic token info
   - Uses a derived name/symbol from the address as the final fallback

2. All hardcoded fallbacks have been removed as requested.

3. When you're ready to implement your caching system, you'll be able to properly populate token names and symbols for well-known tokens like PENGU KILLER.

## Next Steps for Your Implementation

When implementing your caching mechanism, you might want to:

1. Create a database table for token metadata
2. Populate it with known token data (e.g., from your existing knowledge that `5HyZiyaSsQt8VZBAJcULZhtykiVmkAkWLiQJCER9pump` is "THE PENGU KILLER" with symbol "ORCA")
3. Implement a lookup method that checks:
   - Your cache database first
   - Then falls back to the current RPC methods
   - Then uses a derived name if nothing else is available

This approach will give you the best of both worlds - accurate data for known tokens without hardcoding it directly into the source code.
